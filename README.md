# Fallout Save Image Extractor
small utility script to extract screenshots from fallout 3 and new vegas saves (will auto detect)

supports PC .fos files and Xbox 360 .fxs saves (based on some ported logic from [wxPirs](https://digiex.net/threads/wxpirs-extract-content-from-xbox-360-demos-video-dlc-and-arcade-game-containers.9464/))

thanks to the [Vault-Tec Labs Wiki](https://falloutmods.fandom.com/wiki/FOS_file_format) for documenting fallout 3's save format, xbox and new vegas support is my own, along with figuring out exactly how to parse the image data.
